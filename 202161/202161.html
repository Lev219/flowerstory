    <p> These three bouquets of flowers were given to my first group of acting students, and I was lucky to be the assistant teacher for the final year of the acting department at the time. After spending almost nine months with them, I worked on a total of two plays. The first one was as a music director, although I was similar to them in age, they would like to call me Ms. Fan. When they were about to finish the second play of the graduating class - the graduation play in June, my identity and mission as a producer was completed. I took these three bouquets of flowers backstage on the day of the premiere to cheer up my three students who are very close to me. Although the experience was very rewarding, it was also the end of the play that made me decide to give up the theater I had loved for so long...

      <p>这三束花是我送给我第一批上戏的学生的， 当时很幸运成为了上戏表演系毕业班的助教。 在于他们共处了快九个月时间后， 一共带了两部戏 。第一部是做了music director，虽然我与她们年龄相仿，但他们会喜欢叫我范老师。 在他们即将完成毕业班第二部戏-6月份的毕业大戏， 我做为制作人的身份和使命算是完成了。 首演那天我拎上了这三束花去了后台， 给我很亲近的三个学生打气。虽然这次体验让我很有成就感，但是也是这部戏结束后，我决定放弃热爱了这么久的戏剧… </p>

    <p> These two bouquets of flowers from my ex-boyfriend. At first, I received the black and white flowers in the back. I was very unhappy. Because I thought these were the most popular and readily available bouquet at the time at the florist. I felt I deserved better flowers and rarer flowers. Then I got mad at him. He was aggravated and said he didn't know anything about them and that he thought what he had picked was already very beautiful. He and I became confrontational and I cried all day about it.
         <br>
         <br>
         After my boyfriend saw that I was upset, he went to many florists and asked: what is their rarest flower type. Because it was already 5/21, many stores had nothing left to offer. Later on, I found out that he bought white peony at a higher price.
         <br>
         <br>
         In fact, I didn't think the first bouquet was ugly, it was my own preference to compare it with others. Want to receive very unique flowers on this special day. Because every girl likes to be the most extraordinary being. Although the memory of him is sad, but the memory of receiving flowers is joyful.

      <p> 这是两束花都是我前男友送的。一开始收到的是后面的黑白的花。我很不高兴。因为我觉得这种是当时最流行且最容易在花店看到的现成的花束。我觉得自己值得更好的花，更稀有的花材。然后我就对他发了脾气。他很委屈，说他不懂这些，他认为他挑的是很好看的了。我和他产生了对立，我为此哭了一整天。
       <br>
       <br>
       后面我男朋友看我不开心后，去了很多家花店问：他们最稀有的花材是什么。因为当天已经是5/21了，很多店铺已经没什么花了。后面得知他加价购买了白色的芍药。
       <br>
       <br>
       其实我也没有觉得第一束花丑，是我自己喜欢与别人去比较。想要在这个特别的日子收到特别一点的花。因为每个女孩子都喜欢自己是最特殊的存在。虽然回忆起他很悲伤，但收到花的回忆是幸福的。

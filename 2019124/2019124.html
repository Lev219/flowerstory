    <p> The bouquet comes from my best friend. It was my first time in Boston and I was directing the first big Chinese play of my life. The entire cast of 55 people worked from planning to final performance in four months. All four evening performances were almost full. There were more than 400 people in the audience, and about 30-40 foreigners came to see my play, in addition to Chinese people. The most prideful thing is that when I was studying theatre before, I was always more westernized. In less than two years of exposure to Chinese theatre, I have completed a very creative art piece in the whole of Boston: a modern female perspective on the role of women in society and family in the Republic of China. It is a half original and half adaptation - reflecting on the freedom and rights of women. This bouquet was received on the final day, and I was crying at the end of the curtain call, when my friend directly rushed on stage to give this bouquet. <br></br>

      <p> 这束花源于我最好的朋友。 当时是我第一次在波士顿，我在导演自己人生中第一部中文大戏。整个剧组55个人，从筹划到最终演出历时四个月。 4场晚上演出都几乎场场坐满。 一共四百多个观众， 除中国人之外也有大约三四十个外国人过来看了我导演的戏。 最自豪的一点其实是因为之前学习theatre的时候一直都比较westernized体系。接触中文戏剧其实不到两年， 就完成了一个在整个boston可以说是非常creative的一个art piece：用现代女性视角回看民国时期女性在社会家庭中的角色。算是半原创半改编-反思女性的自由和权利。这束花在final day的时候收到的，最后谢幕的时候我一直在哭，我朋友直接冲上台献了这束花。 </p>

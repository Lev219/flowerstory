    <p> Can't remember the date anymore. But what I can remember is when I was very, very small. In a shopping mall, there was an event about flower arrangement. My mother encouraged me to participate. It was actually my first time to encounter flower arranging and I thought everything was new. The flowers provided for the event were immortal flowers. The original flowers were coated with a special material that made the flowers stay intact without touching the air.
        <br>
        <br>
        A few days after the event, I looked for a flower store that had this kind of flower material. I quietly wanted to prepare a surprise for my mom. I remember it took me 6-7 hours to make it. Because I am a very obsessive person, I changed many versions over and over again. Underneath the flower there was a starfish leg on which I wrote my mom's name spelling as a finish to the whole piece.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't think it's that stunning now, but after all these years it's still as good as if I had just finished it. We have moved several times during this period, yet mom still keeps it so perfect. Every time I see it, I can imagine the strong love between a little girl and her mother.

      <p> 已经记不得日期了。但能记得的是我很小很小的时候。在一个商场里，当时举办关于插花的活动。妈妈非常鼓励我参加。这其实算是我第一次接触插花，觉得一切都是新奇的。活动提供的花是永生花。是在原本的花上涂上一种特殊的材料使得花在不接触空气的情况下可以一直不凋谢。 </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      这场活动后的几天，我特地找了一家花店有这种花材。悄悄的想为妈妈准备惊喜。记得当时制作它花了我6-7小时。因为我是一个很纠结的人，我反复改了很多个版本。在花的下面有一个海星腿，我在上面写了妈妈的名字拼写作为整个作品的收尾。
      <br>
      <br>
      现在看其实觉得它并没有多么惊艳，但是这么多年过去了它却依旧如同当时刚做完一样。这期间我们搬过几次家，然而妈妈依旧把它保留的如此完美。每次看到它，都能联想到一个小女孩与她妈妈之间强烈的爱意。

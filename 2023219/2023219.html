    <p> This is the first bouquet of flowers I received this year. The beginning of my 21 years old starts with this bouquet. This is my second year celebrating my birthday in the US. I had planned to spend my birthday in a normal way this year. What I didn't expect was that my best friend flew over from Boston to surprise me. The next thing I knew was that the morning of my birthday, I received a phone call: "Hello, you have a bouquet of flowers that needs to be signed for, I'm downstairs.“ At first I was a little wary that it was a spam call and wasn't ready to go downstairs. Until she said it should be from your friend or mother for you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The flower delivery was from a Chinese person. The first thing she said to me was: Happy birthday, here are your flowers. I didn't even react at that time, because I was already completely fascinated by the flowers when I saw them. It was just so beautiful. It was the prettiest bouquet I had ever seen.
        <br>
        <br>
        I asked her do you know who gave it to me? She said: it should be your mother. When I heard the word mother, my tears flowed straight down. It may be touching, it may be exciting, it may be unbelievable... It was as if time was stuck in the word-mother.
        <br>
        <br>
        Later I noticed that my mom asked my best friend to help order the bouquet. Mom said she didn't want me to not receive flowers on my birthday because I love the feeling of receiving flowers. I DO. I really like it. Because that moment will make me feel happinesses . Someone is loving me, someone cares about me. Everything is beautiful.

      <p>这是我今年收到的第一束花。21岁的开始从这束花开始。这是我第二年在美国过生日。本来打算今年普通的度过就结束了。没想到的是闺蜜先从波士顿特地飞过来给我惊喜。其次就是生日当天早上，我收到了一通电话：你好，你有一束花需要签收，我人就在楼下。起初我还有点警惕，担心是诈骗电话，不准备下楼。直到她说应该是你朋友或者母亲为你准备的。我才一下子跳起来，快速下楼。
        <br>
        <br>
        送花的姐姐也是一位中国人。她对我说的第一句话是：生日快乐，这是你的花。我当时都没反应过来，因为我看到花的时候已经完全被花所吸引了。实在是太漂亮了。是我见过最好看的花束。
        <br>
        <br>
        我问她你知道是谁送给我的吗？她说：应该是你母亲。当我听到母亲二字时，我眼泪直接流了下来。可能是感动，可能是激动，可能是难以置信…仿佛时间都停留在了母亲二字。
        <br>
        <br>
        后来我才得知是我妈妈拜托我闺蜜帮忙定的花束。妈妈说她不希望我生日时没有收到花，因为我最喜欢收到花的感觉了。是的。我真的很喜欢。因为那一刻会让我感觉是幸福的。有人在爱我，有人在乎我。一切都是美好的。

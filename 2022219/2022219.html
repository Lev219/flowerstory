    <p> The first year I spent my birthday abroad. All my close friends were not in New York at that time. Surprisingly, a new girl I met at parsons at the time was willing to spend my birthday with me. I told her that I like flowers. I didn't expect her to remember. She took a long time to choose what flowers to send me. I heard that the bouquet was not the original one she ordered, she said the previous one from the merchant was dying and she was not happy with it. Before we met, she ran through several stores and finally found me the most satisfying.

        Although we are not in touch much now because of some reasons. But I am always grateful to her for making my first birthday in New York so enjoyable.

      <p> 第一年在国外过生日。身边关系好的朋友当时都不在纽约。出乎意料的是当时在parsons新认识的一位女生，她很愿意陪我过生日。我跟她讲过我喜欢花。没想到她记得并且还特地为我挑选了很久送我什么花。听说这束花不是原来她订的那束，她说之前那束商家给的是快凋谢了，她不满意。在我们见面前，她跑了好几家最后给我找到了最满意的。

        虽然我们现在因为专业原因，不怎么联系了。但我始终很感谢她，让我第一个在纽约的生日过的如此开心。</p>

    <p> In 2021, when I first came to the United States, it was the first time in my life that I could not be with my mom on her birthday. At that time, I thought for a long time that there was nothing I could give my mom as a gift. Mom didn't need anything. Expensive gifts would actually cost her money. Finally, I think if I send her a very nice bouquet of flowers, she will definitely like it. Mom was very surprised and touched when she received it. Mom cried for a long time that day.

      <p> 2021年，我刚来到美国，是我长这么大第一次妈妈生日不能够陪在她身边。当时思考了很久，感觉没什么礼物可以送给妈妈。妈妈什么都不缺。贵重的礼物其实也是在花的钱。最后觉得如果送她一束很好看的花，她肯定会喜欢。妈妈收到的时候很惊喜，也很感动。妈妈那天哭了好久。 </p>
